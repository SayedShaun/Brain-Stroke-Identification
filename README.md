# Project Title
Improving Brain Stroke Diagnosis and Treatment Using AI and Medical Imaging for Enhanced Precision and Patient Care.

This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on various models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project also includes Streamlit integration for creating an interactive web application.

## Project Structure

- .streamlit: Configuration files for Streamlit, a tool for designing web applications.
- Image: (All necessary images contained here that have been used for creating the application)
- My_CNN_Model: (Saved NN Model)
- My_XGB_Model: (Saved Xgboost Model)
- __pycache__: Python bytecode cache directory.
- ANN_Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the Artificial Neural Network.
- CNN_Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network.
- LICENSE: MIT License for the project.
- README.md: This file, the README containing information about the project.
- Text_Helper.py: A Python script or module for text-related tasks.
- app.py: Python file for the Streamlit web application.
- requirements.txt: List of required libraries and their versions.

## Usage

- **Setting up Environment:**
  - Clone Repository https://github.com/SayedShaun/Brain-Stroke-Prediction-and-Detection.git
  - Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed.
  - Use the `requirements.txt` file to install the required dependencies.

- **Running the Streamlit App:**
